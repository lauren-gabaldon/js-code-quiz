This project is a quick quiz testing a user's knowledge on some simple Javascript information. My understanding of creating For Loops hasn't fully clicked and my work has a lot of collaboration with other students from my class.

The current function of this code though it doesn't meet every requirement yet is as follows:

Page invites a user to test their knowledge on some Javascript.

User is instructed to press the start button to begin the test.

Once start button is pressed the multiple answer quiz begins with a shuffled questions For Loop.
a reset function with a While Loop is nested in my showQuestion function to remove the labeled answer buttons and display the answer options once the game begins.

Each answer option has it's own button however I haven't yet unlocked the key to actually store the answers instead of a mouse event in the console log.

Once the game is started a timer begins counting backwards from 60 seconds, however it's functionality isn't called to stop once the questions end, but does end once timer hits zero.

a score board with the users initials are also not displayed once the quiz ends as of yet. I am continuing testing my own knowledge in creating these functionalities to the page but as of yet, I haven't formulated them to work quite yet.

I hope in the time being the questions are both helpful even in their simplicity while also providing a light hearted laugh
