This project is a quick quiz testing a user's knowledge on some simple Javascript information.

The current function of this code is as follows:

Page invites a user to test their knowledge on some Javascript.

User is instructed to press the start button to begin the test.

Once start button is pressed the multiple answer quiz begins with a shuffled questions For Loop.
a reset function with a While Loop is nested in my showQuestion function to remove the labeled answer buttons and display the answer options once the game begins.

Each answer option has it's own button and has functionality to accumulate correct answers locally.

Once the game is started a timer begins counting backwards from 60 seconds,if an incorrect answer is chosen then 5 seconds is deducted from the timer.

a score board with the users initials are also not displayed once the quiz ends as of yet.
